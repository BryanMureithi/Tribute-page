            <h2>Here's a timeline of Dedan Kimathi's life:</h2>
            <ul class="tribute">
                <li> <strong>1920</strong> - Born in Tetu</li>
                <li>His middle name, Waciuri, means self-reliance</li>
                <li><strong>1940</strong> - Kimathi enlisted in the British Army, but was discharged after a month, allegedly
                     for drunkenness and persistent violence against his fellow recruits.</li>
                <li><strong>1947</strong> - He had a short stint working as an untrained teacher</li>     
                <li><strong>1949</strong> - Became an active member of the Kenya African Union and on being banned by the
                    British colonial government, he proceeded to join the Mau Mau movement.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1950</strong> - He joined the Kenya Land Freedom Army also known as the MauMau and was
                     in charge of oath administration.</li>
                <li><strong>1952</strong> - Kimathi quickly rose to become a leader of the movement where he was appointed
                    as a freedom army following the assassination of his counterpart Waruhio Itote.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1956</strong> - Kimathi got captured by the British forces. He was put on trial and later sentenced 
                    to death.
                </li>
                <li>A court presided over by Chief Justice Oâ€™Connor and with an all-black jury of Kenyans sentenced
                     him to death while he lay in a hospital bed at the General Hospital Nyeri. His appeal was
                      dismissed, and the death sentence upheld.</li>
                <li><strong>1957</strong> - Despite rampant appeals from local and foreign authorities, Kimathi was eventually 
                    executed by hanging and his body buried at an unmarked grave, and his burial site
                     remains unknown to this date. The British Government has never released classified
                      information about his death despite  international appeal.</li>
